# tutorial

This github repository will hold any public source codes used in tutorials that I make.
I will be adding more tutorials over time, by adding more branches to this github repository.

The `master` branch will contain this README and supporting documentation. Other branches will
be considered the ending point of a particular tutorial.

Additional documentation for parts might be found in the README of a particular part.

## Hardhat Tutorials

I plan on making a series of tutorials about using Hardhat with Typescript support to interface
with Ethereum-based chains.

Branches:
